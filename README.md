# Linear Regression

Welcome to the **Linear Regression Models** repository! This repository serves as a collection of Linear Regression models, each created using different datasets to demonstrate the versatility of Linear Regression in solving various real-world problems. The repository is structured to provide easy access to different examples and help users understand the application of Linear Regression.

## Repository Overview

This repository aims to illustrate how Linear Regression can be applied in different contexts, providing an educational resource for understanding how relationships between input variables and output variables can be modeled. Whether you are just starting to learn about Linear Regression or you are looking for a resource to understand its practical applications, this repository is designed to assist you.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into individual folders, each containing a specific Linear Regression model. Each folder includes all relevant files and explanations to help you understand the implementation.

### Folder Contents

Each model folder contains:

- **Dataset/**: The dataset used for training and testing the model.
- **model.ipynb or model.py**: A Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) or Python script (`.py`) that includes the code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- **README.md**: A brief description of the dataset, the goal of the model, and insights derived from the analysis.
- **Results/**: Visualizations, performance metrics, or other relevant outputs generated during the model's evaluation.

## How to Use This Repository

### Step 1: Navigate to a Model Folder

Each folder is named to identify the specific model and dataset used, such as `Model_1` or `Model_2`. Navigate to the folder of the model you are interested in.

### Step 2: Review Documentation

Inside each model folder, you will find a `README.md` file that provides an overview of the dataset and explains the model's purpose. This documentation will help you understand the motivation behind the model.

### Step 3: Run the Code

The code for each model is provided in Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) or Python script (`.py`) format. You can:

- Run the Jupyter Notebook interactively to see step-by-step outputs and visualizations.
- Execute the Python script using any Python environment to quickly reproduce the results.

### Step 4: Analyze the Results

The `Results` directory in each model folder contains outputs such as performance metrics (e.g., R² score) and visualizations that help you understand the model's performance.

## Understanding Linear Regression

Linear Regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between one or more independent variables (also known as features or predictors) and a dependent variable (also known as the target or outcome). It is one of the most fundamental techniques in machine learning and data science, especially for regression tasks, where the goal is to predict continuous values.

### Types of Linear Regression

1. **Simple Linear Regression**: Models the relationship between a single independent variable and a dependent variable by fitting a straight line.
  
2. **Multiple Linear Regression**: Models the relationship between two or more independent variables and a dependent variable.

### Mathematical Formulation

The general formula for Linear Regression is:
```math
y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \cdots + \beta_n x_n + \epsilon
```

Where:
- $`y`$: Dependent variable (target).
- $`x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n`$: Independent variables (features).
- $`\beta_0`$: Intercept term, representing the value of $`y`$ when all $`x_i`$ are zero.
- $`\beta_1, \beta_2, \dots, \beta_n`$: Coefficients representing the weight of each feature.
- $`\epsilon`$: Error term, representing the noise or residuals in the data.

### Assumptions of Linear Regression

Linear Regression works under the following key assumptions:
1. **Linearity**: There is a linear relationship between the dependent and independent variables.
2. **Independence**: Observations are independent of each other.
3. **Homoscedasticity**: The residuals (`errors`) have constant variance across the data.
4. **Normality**: The residuals are normally distributed.

### Evaluating Model Performance

To evaluate the performance of a Linear Regression model, the following metrics are commonly used:

- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Measures the average of the squares of the errors. It is calculated as:
```math
  \text{MSE} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2
```

- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: The square root of MSE, providing a measure of error in the same units as the target variable.

```math
  \text{RMSE} = \sqrt{\text{MSE}}
```

- **R² Score**: Represents the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables. It is calculated as:

```math
  R^2 = 1 - \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \bar{y})^2}
```

### Implementation

Linear Regression can be implemented using libraries like `scikit-learn`, which provide a simple interface for model fitting, prediction, and evaluation.

## Use Cases for Linear Regression

Linear Regression can be applied to any problem where there is a need to model relationships between variables. Examples of its use include:

- Predictive modeling to estimate unknown values based on known features.
- Analyzing correlations between independent and dependent variables in datasets.
- Feature impact analysis to determine which variables contribute most to the output.

These applications illustrate how Linear Regression can provide both predictive insights and an understanding of relationships between variables.
